      "{'text': \"Well it's just that, you know, a pound, or a hundred pounds today, is not the same as a hundred pounds in a year's time, or two, two years' time.\\nRight.\\nSo that would be opportunity cost?\\nThat's right, yes, that's right, so, in actual fact, this area here, right, is going to be the discounted sum of all future rural incomes.\\nAlright, now if we look at the, the rural instead of the urban wage rate, right, up here alright, now let's just say that it takes that amount of time before this individual gets a job in the urban area, alright, now if we discount alright the erm, the rural, the urban wages right, that's all this\\nWhy have you just discounted it to there?\\nSorry?\\nWhy have you discounted it to W R?\\nWell it's, well, er, there's no need why that should be the case, it could be, you know, it could look something like that.\\nBut, up in the, there the migrant's decision making process will be, is this area here right, is that area there, greater than that area there.\\nAlright, so this is the discounted sum in er, in non-agriculture, in the urban area, and this is the value, the discounted sum in agriculture.\\nNow, clearly on the, on the way I've drawn this diagram it is.\\nRight, but that's going to depend on right, not only the wage differential, now if the wage differential is very large it's likely that this discounted sum is going to, you know, be larger than that.\\nBut it also depends on the time it takes to get the job.\\nI mean if we got a job somewhere out here then it clearly wouldn't be.\\nSo it's this, it's the time taken to get this erm, er, to get the job's going to be important.\\nNow if we think of W U as being er, the expected value of the urban wage, and that equals the probability of getting a job, multiplied by the actual urban wages, alright then this probability of getting a job is going to be important as well.\\nAnd that's it then, scruffy diagram, but what more have we got?\\nAn urban wage, a rural wage, right, we discount those wages over time, right and that area there, shading the area in the blue sort of box, then this it's erm, it's going to be rational for this er, migrant, this person to become a migrant.\\nEven though, I mean this doesn't say anything about unemployment levels, levels of unemployment.\\nUnem the level of unemployment is subsumed between, well, within the time it takes to get a job, and also the probability of, of getting a job.\\nAlright.\\nSo this sort of, even that's just what the Harrison model erm, tells us, right, so that's, unemployment rates are, are virtually erm, unimportant in the migrant's decision.\\nUnemployment rates now, it's because they may well be, if they're acting rationally, discount over a very large, long period of time.\\nOkay just er, just to ask, is this erm, migration, it, does it cause a problem?\\nI mean I thought that migration was the er, would be the cure of all ills, in that, you know, we've got wage differentials here in this, in this hypothetical economy.\\nSurely if you migrate that increases the supply of labour, it reduces the supply of labour in the rural sector, it increases the supply of labour in er, the urban sector, unless wage, wage rates should equalize?\\nNo.\\nWhat, what, why don't, why doesn't, why don't wage rates equalize?\\nBecause erm, the urban sector is normally considered to be capital intensive a sector, and the rural area in L D Cs are considered more labour intensive, and so erm, obviously when you get an influx of labour, and changes to the capital to labour ratio\\nMhm\\nerm, and you would see er, a shift in capital to, to agriculture as the return on capital in urban falls,\\nmhm\\nand this would, you would think, because there's a shift back of capital to agriculture you'd get a rise in agricultural wage rates because that changes the capital to labour ratio again and so this would counteract the movement.\\nHowever, there is a problem, capital is not perfectly mobile, like you can apply a new machine into, well maybe you could cos that's .\\nWhatever, you can't apply the urban type of capital back onto the land, so it's okay to say this would work if capital was completely and perfectly mobile, but it isn't so, you don't get that and you don't get balanced growth of that.\\nBecause er, everything shifts in the wrong direction.\\nThat's right, I mean, in order to eq equalize wages between sector, labour and also capital has to be perfectly mobile.\\nNow, if it's not, we know that labour isn't, isn't perfectly mobile, it appeared, migration would seem to suggest it's, it's pretty mobile geographically, but it may not be particularly mobile occupationally.\\nSo that these people go to the urban areas to get the jobs, they're not trained erm, for these jobs right and as a result, these wages rates still, may still be maintained despite the fact there are lots of people who are quite happy to take wages erm, in, take up jobs in the urban sectors, it's the fact that sort of, employers don't want them, because they don't have the requisite skills.\\nAlso, where, what are the erm, what're the highest paid jobs in the urban sector?\\nThey are essentially in developing countries.\\nThey are essentially government jobs.\\nRight.\\nNow, er, without wishing to generalize too much, bribery, corruption, you know, it's not what you know, it's who you know, are very important factors in er, in employment in developing countries.\\nAnd as a result they are\\nIt's much nicer to say patronage, you promise to say patronage.\\nAh, patronage, okay, that's er, a nice euphemism to see the\\nThen you don't like slander people.\\nThat's right, in that erm, you're, the probability of you getting a well paid job is greatly enhanced, if not guaranteed if you know er, the people who are employing you.\\nAnd this sort of thing goes, is, is rife in developing countries.\\nI mean the old boy network is pretty bad in this country, but er, it's similar sorts of things go on in developing countries, and because there's much less of an industrial sector there, the government sector itself, erm, plays a very important role in, in employment.\\nNow, was it you Lyn who had some statistics some saying er, what proportion\\nFine I've got,I've got to use stat statistics to\\nWell it works, erm, there were some\\nYes.\\nI can't remember if it was you or somebody else, had er, some data as to how many of the er, jobs in urban areas where the government\\nI put erm, studies by Helen and Tate, nineteen eighty three, found public sector employment averaged forty four percent of non-agricultural employment in twenty L D Cs and in extreme cases were Tanzania and Zambia, were as high as seventy eight and eighty one percent respectively.\\nAnd I think he quote those, or they didn't quote them in much, as much detail as I did in the lectures.\\nI'd got these figures down, but I hadn't really got anything against them, he just quickly went through the percentages so yes.\\nOkay, so\\nAnd developed countries averaged twenty four percent, so it's twice as much as developed countries.\\nRight, so given sort of erm, public and semi-public institutions, right, represent a large proportion of the non- agricultural erm, employment opportunities, and as a result, alright, the rates of pay in the, in the civil service, essentially, are going to, going to determine erm, the urban, the urban wage rate.\\nNow if those, erm, wages in the civil service are set, not through sort of market process, but sort of through institutional er, constraints, you know, it's unlikely there's going to be sort of er, union power erm, in these sorts of jobs, but nevertheless, civil servants tend to do quite well at giving themselves pay increases\\nConservative government.\\nand er, and as a result, you know, institutes, the wages in government bodies tend to be quite high, and because gov government bodies represent such a large proportion of er, non- agricultural employment they, they represent a much more sort of, a much more potent influence than they would do in a, in a developed country where the government sector is much, much smaller.\\nErm okay what was the importance of implication of er, Harrison model?\\nThere was one policy implication.\\nThat, what was it, that erm people still move.\\nObviously, we that right, people will still move if unemployment's high, but if you try, if the government tries and gets rid of unem urban unemployment, say people have moved because of it, so there's unemployment there to start with because of the reasons we've discussed earlier, so then the government said okay, well let's get rid of the unemployment that has occurred already, by erm, either, at the same wage rate trying to well yes, the same, they'll keep wage rates the same, but erm, increase, you know, make the public sector bigger or, or do something to create urban jobs, and basically all it will do is, encourage more migrants because they'll see the probability of getting a job will increase so the expected wage will increase so you'll get migration on top of what's already occurring.\\nAnd, erm, you won't solve anything.\\nThat's right, so, if you want to try and erm, minimize urban unemployment, right, or it's futile to try and minimize urban unemployment by erm, er, establishing employment er, job creation schemes in urban areas, because that will increase the probability of getting a job if you're a migrant.\\nRight, so there are these government job creation schemes, alright.\\nNow, because it's typically observed in the Harrison model shows this under certain circumstances to be the case, that, erm, a sort of erm, migration elasticity with respect to income differentials, right, is much greater than the erm,\\nThe rate of unemployment, the level of unemployment\\nThat's right, yes, yes, that's right, because erm, there's a gre there's a higher elasticity of migration inelasticity in respect to income differentials than there is to unemployment, any job creation schemes will lead to more migration, rather than, rather than less, so how, how best to get round the problem?\\nIf job creation schemes aren't in urban areas, are the best way to get round them, isn't it, if we can show, quite simply, that job creation schemes lead to more migration, which lead to more unemployment.\\nThe policy's self repeating, what policies might ?\\nA policy of cross-training,for all areas.\\nOkay, yeah, so, what might those, what form might those policies take, what might they be?\\non it .\\nYes, population controls, that's right, that's one, I mean, one reason, one way of getting rid of the migration is to, is to, is to limit population growth.\\nWhere's the population growth highest?\\nIt's at its highest in rural areas, this is what's being done.\\nErm, population control is always focused out in the rural areas,the most difficult place to do it, because populations are dispersed, er, that's where population growth, right, is the highest.\\nAny other?\\nMaking incentives to actually raise the wage rates in the, in the rural areas so, sort of to, to increase production or, and through, through farming.\\nTo improve their situation,\\nRight, yeah\\nimprove their wages through farming and perhaps\\nThat's right,\\nput more infrastructure in so that then the farmers can send their children to school rather than work on the land.\\nyeah, that's right, what we want to try and do is to improve the erm, the returns to, to agriculture which is the main form of er, sort of income in rural areas.\\nI mean if you do things like that while improving infrastructure, erm, setting up credit, government credit facilities, er, so, so, so we can lend, we could lend money to small farms.\\nIncrease in information about unem unemployment itself, that is a, that is a problem, people have this misapprehensions about the probability of getting a job\\nYou could also erm, start to recognize the benefit of the rural sector, and one reason why they were discriminating, L D Cs tended to want to ignore that and sort of shun it, because it's not sort of a glamorous image they were trying to hope for in the urban sector, and, so, if they did help them, say give them units, like the repair men, units to work in, and they put them in really totally crappy accommodation, and up not where you need it, and not where people pass by with their motors and things, they, they'd put them somewhere up on a hill, overlooking a city, so erm, to encourage the informal sector by erm, sort of on a par with the formal sector because erm, their inter- reacting, inter-relating now, like they're providing cheap inputs for the formal industries and, and the formal industries are pro providing clientele all for the informal sector, and so it's all inter-linked and, and it's there now.\\nIt's not going to disappear, cos it's quite a large part of urban areas.\\nThey could do that.\\nYes, we want to try and improve resource allocation in the economy and one way of doing that is not necessarily subsidizing agricultural production, but remove the taxes on agricultural growth.\\nAlright, and effectively what's, what's happening is that the government sectors in erm, in developing countries are very highly subsidized.\\nRight, they're overmanned, alright, they have very high wages, alright, er, that is one of the major courses of er, causes of resource mis-allocation, it's this very large, very inefficient government sector.\\nAnd er, one way to, to get people to stay on the land is to introduce some sort of, what we might call market disciplines, if that wasn't such a dirty word, er, into the government, the government sector where there are clear inefficiencies.\\nOkay, right, erm it's nearly time to go, but before we do, can I just give you some bits and pieces, you, you may well have copies of last year's exam paper, but if you haven't, this is for development and integration of trade er, have a look at those sorts of essays you're being asked to do.\\nBut also, look as those er, those short answers, now it's important that you answer the short answer questions well alright, because it's, it's a lot easier to get good marks on a short answer question, providing you do it well, than it is on a long answer question.\\nAlright, erm, but most people don't, don't ans don't answer short answer questions very well at all, and that's why they get low, low marks for them.\\nAlways re bear in mind, that whenever you do a short answer question, right, you've only got fifteen minutes to do it in.\\nRight, there, there isn't a great deal that you can get in, in fifteen minutes.\\nBut what, what you must have, right, is a definition of erm, the er, sort of thing that you're asked to write about.\\nI mean, factor price equalization, intra-industry measuring intra-industry trade, optimal intervention, reciprocal dumping, they're all jargon, bits of jargon effect effectively, so you must, you must have a definition.\\nRight now, although the determinals in industrial specialization within countries, alright, now although you can't really define that, you might be able to say something about industrial specialization.\\nYou know it's fairly obvious what it is, but with most of these will, will require, require a definition.\\nRight, so you must put a definition, a definition in there.\\nAn example of it in use, and you must have ex what I'm saying, it's very important to have empirical erm, examples in your essays, right, because they will also be required in the short answer questions as well.\\nRight, you know, what is an example of erm, reciprocal dumping?\\nRight now you may, erm,don't know anything in particular, but I know that the European Community and the United, United States are always trying to out, erm, beat each other in terms of subsidies on food products, so put, put that in.\\nReciprocal dumping, erm, you know, one very good example would be agricultural trade between European Community and erm, and America.\\nAlright, if it's a, so you, you've got to have a definition, alright, you must have a, an example of it in, in action.\\nAny form of empirical evidence is useful, alright, erm sometimes you know, you're asked, you know, what is the effective protection, or define, or write brief a brief essay on effective protection, right you'll, you'll want to say something there about how it's measured.\\nNow what essentially, what you're doing, is that you're writing an essay in very, very condensed form, so it's just, I mean you still, still must have the same recipe in there when you write a short answer, right, but you just have to be very, very brief, so you know,para paragraph on definition, you know, paragraph of examples, right, erm, paragraph on some sort of explanation or erm, how it's, how it's measured erm, has it been a contentious issue erm, what are the problems with this er, with this concept erm, right, you've got to get those sort of things in there, like you would in an essay, if you were asked to write an essay on reciprocal dumping you'd, you'd have all those things in there, right, but you only need to write a sentence, a sentence about them.\\nYou know, nobody's expecting three or four sides, right, you've got quarter of an hour, not erm, you know, if, if you can write a side a half you, you'll be doing much better than most people, alright, so you're just thinking about a side really, depending on how big your handwriting is.\\nBut you must have, you know, don't ramble on about the same thing, right, cos, for, for, for any more than a couple of sentences, cos then, you know, you c start entering into sort of diminishing marginal returns very, very quickly on these short answer questions, what you want to, do is sort of say a sentence about as much as you can rather than go into in depth discussion about erm, any particular aspect.\\nAlright, so it's a bit of er, a sort of blunderbuss type of approach that you've got, that you've got to use.\\nGet a definition in, get an application in, get empirical evidence in, get measurement problems in erm, get sort of contentious issues type of, or criticisms in erm, don't draw, don't do diagrams as they're probably, the only, the only principal difference between this and an essay, you just haven't got the time, right, so don't be tempted, unless you can do a very quick diagram that sum, sums it up.\\nAlright, I don't recommend doing diagrams cos you spend five, five ten minutes drawing the diagram and explaining you know, what the curves are on it, erm, so you don't really need to draw, draw diagrams in these short answer questions.\\nAgain that's only a general principle.\\nOccasionally you might be, but erm, if I can, if you look at er, the erm, the European Community's erm, short answers, right, they've actually given you an except there, a dia diagram, right.\\nQuestion, question one,question two, alright.\\nIt's a pretty complicated diagram, I wouldn't expect you to draw that in fifteen minutes, and explain the, the\\nIf they give you a diagram like that, can you just talk about the lines, you don't have to say what they are?\\nNo, that's right, yes.\\nBasically, you could say like with gains or something, gains are A, B, C.\\nYes\\nThat's right,\\nI reckon that's, that's the way that\\nit will be assu it will be assumed that, yes\\neverything on there is known about that, just specific areas.\\nAlright, but you know, you've got so little time, you know, fifteen minutes is very, very short period of time, so whatever you say\\nNot wanting to induce panicking .\\nWhat I do recommend you do is er, you know, use these short answers in your, in your revision, and sort of, you know, revise on say interim district trade, and then just write a question in fifteen minutes, and you realize that you can't really write very much, and it's good discipline, because once you've made the mistake, you know, of writing, you know, two paragraphs on some aspect of it, you realize you haven't got any time to, to do anything else.\\nYou won't, hopefully you won't make that mistake again, so, short, sweet, crisp answers to these erm, these short answer questions.\\nDon't bother doing diagrams, get a sentence in on everything you know, right although it's not\\nWell, that doesn't sound very sophisticated to say, these are the questions when you just write everything you know about a particular issue.\\nBut they are, you do straight out what you can think up about it.\\nYes, that's essentially, essentially it.\\nApart from the essays\\nwrite anyway for thirty minutes\\nNot quite the same approach there, but I mean, it's not, not everything you know, but write something about everything you know about\\nAlright\\nthe short answers.\\nA, a sentence on everything you can, think of that, that relates to it, but if you do,do practise them, it's only just to, to talk about it, it's difficult to know what you can write in fifteen minutes.\\nRight, I'm here vir virtually throughout the vacation, erm, I'll be here until the beginning of next term, so if you are having problems of any sort, or want me to run through something with you, just er, feel free to disturb me.\\nSorry, sorry\\nIt's alright, so come along and see me, if you have any problems, it's much better you talk it over with me before the problem gets out of hand.\\nAlright, so, come and see me as soon as the problems start to emerge, and I can probably tell you that you're, you're wasting time and energy worrying about it, so\\nwe're going to sit and\\nso, er, come and see me before you know, if you are having any problems, just come along.\\nOkay, don't forget to have a few days break over Christmas, don't work all the time, have a jolly good time.\\nSee you next year.\\nYes, bye\", 'doc-id': 'd67176e066a5b0b49b31180ae8c9b7cc7af57ea263b895bcd7a0f8e59c521253', 'category': 'child-available-speech', 'data-source':

      "{'text': 'Er was eens een oud moedervarken met drie biggetjes. Helaas had ze niet genoeg eten om ze te houden, dus stuurde ze ze eropuit om hun eigen geluk te zoeken.\\n\\nToen het eerste varken naar buiten ging, ontmoette hij een man met een bundel stro. Het varken zei: \"Meneer, geef me alstublieft het stro zodat ik een huis kan bouwen.\"\\n\\nDe man gaf hem het stro en het varken bouwde een huis van stro. Even later kwam er een grote boze wolf voorbij. Hij klopte op de deur en zei: \"Hé varkentje, laat me binnen.\"\\n\\nHet varken antwoordde: \"Nee, nee, geen haar op mijn varkenskin die daaraan denkt.\"\\n\\n\"Dan ga ik heel hard snuiven en blaas ik je huis omver,\" zei de wolf. En dat deed hij. Hij snoof en hij snoof, en hij blies de deur weg. Het varkentje rende snel weg voordat er bouillon van hem gemaakt zou worden.\\n\\nZijn broer, het tweede varken, had een man ontmoet met een bundel stokken. Het varken zei: \"Meneer, geef me alstublieft de stokken zodat ik een huis kan bouwen.\" De man gaf hem de stokken en het varken bouwde een huis van stokken. Hij zat trots in zijn huis toen hij een klop op de deur hoorde. Het was zijn kleine broertje. \"De wolf blies mijn huis weg! Mag ik alsjeblieft hier blijven?\".\\n\\n\"Natuurlijk, mijn huis is gemaakt van stokken, het is zeker veilig!\" zei zijn broer.\\n\\nToen kwam de grote boze wolf langs het huisje van stokken en zei: \"Hé, varkentje, laat me binnen.\"\\n\\n\"Nee, nee, geen haar op mijn varkenskin die daaraan denkt\", antwoordde het varken.\\n\\n\"Dan snuif ik heel hard en dan blaas ik en blaas ik tot je huis omver valt,\" zei de wolf. En dat deed hij. Hij snoof en hij snoof, en hij blies de deur naar beneden en het huis viel omver. De twee varkens renden snel weg naar hun andere broer.\\n\\nHet derde varken was een man tegengekomen met een lading stenen. Het varken zei: \"Alstublieft, meneer, geef me die stenen zodat ik een huis kan bouwen.\" De man gaf hem de stenen en het varken bouwde een huis van stenen.\\n\\nHij zat lekker in zijn huis toen hij geklop op de deur hoorde. Het waren zijn broers! \"De wolf heeft onze huizen omver geblazen! Kunnen we alsjeblieft hier blijven?\"\\n\\n\"Natuurlijk, mijn huis is gemaakt van baksteen, het is zeker veilig!\" zei de broer. \"Maar de wolf komt hier ook zeker langs. Laten we een plan maken om ervoor te zorgen dat hij ons nooit meer lastigvalt.\" Dus bedachten de drie biggetjes een plan. En zoals het varken had voorspeld, kwam de wolf naar zijn huis...De grote boze wolf kwam inderdaad bij het huis van bakstenen en zei: \"Hé, varkentje, laat me binnen.\"\\n\\n\"Nee, nee, geen haar op mijn varkenskin die daaraan denkt\", antwoordde het varken.\\n\\n\"Dan snuif ik heel heel hard en blaas ik en blaas ik tot je huis omver valt\" zei de wolf.\\n\\nDus de wolf snoof en hij snoof en hij snoof en hij snoof en hij snoof en hij snoof, maar hij kon de deur niet omver blazen. Hij besefte al snel dat hij de deur niet kon openen door te snuiven en te blazen.\\n\\nToen werd de wolf natuurlijk boos en besloot dat hij door de schoorsteen naar de varkens toe zou gaan.\\n\\nMaar de drie biggetjes wisten wat hij van plan was en ze hadden een pan met water boven het vuur gehangen. En net toen de wolf door de schoorsteen kwam, namen ze de deksel van de pan. De hete stoom bereikte de grote boze wolf en met een luid gehuil schoot de wolf weer omhoog de schoorsteen in!\\n\\n\"Auw, auw, auw! Oh, jullie nare varkens! Op een dag zal ik jullie te pakken krijgen!\" en de wolf rende weg zo snel als hij kon.\\n\\nEn daarna? Daarna kwam de grote boze wolf nooit meer terug, hij was te bang geworden voor de drie slimme biggetjes.\\n\\nEn de varkens? Zij leefden nog lang en gelukkig en heel gezellig samen in het huis van bakstenen.', 'doc-id': '32151f2ad68bbb60a2ec46bfa1693a72aa838c57817ee3bd7a222a8ad217ed51', 'category': 'child-books', 'data-source': 'Ririro', 'script': 'Latn', 'age-estimate': 'n/a', 'license': 'cc-by-nc-4.0', 'misc': '{\"source_url\": \"https://ririro.com/nl/de-drie-kleine-biggetjes/\"}', 'num-tokens': 680, 'language': 'nld'}\n",

ところで、そのなかでも特に深く想い起されるのは、このような科学の進むべき正しい道をはっきりとわたしたちに示してくれた最初の科学者のことであります。科学は自然におけるいろいろなはたらきを研究してゆく学問であることは、上にも述べた通りであり、またそういう意味での自然の研究はごく古い時代からあったには違いないのですが、実際にその研究をどのような方法で進めてゆくべきかと云うことを明らかにしたのは、十六世紀から十七世紀の前半にわたってイタリヤで名だかかったガリレオ・ガリレイであったということは、今日一般に認められている処であって、その意味でこのガリレイは自然科学の先祖とあがめられているのです。それで私はここで幾らかのすぐれた科学者の事蹟について皆さんにお話しして見ようとするのに当って、まずガリレイのことから始めるのが、当然の順序であると考えるのです。\\n\\nピザにおけるガリレイ\\n\\nピザというのは、イタリヤの中部からやや北方にある都会で、そこにはヅオモ大寺と呼ばれる大きな寺院があり、そのなかに名だかい斜塔が立っています。十六七世紀頃にはかなりに盛んな町であったのですが、ガリレイはこの町で一五六四年の二月十五日に生まれました。父はヴィンセンツォ・ガリレイという人で、その家は以前にはイタリヤの貴族であってフィレンツェという都市に住んでいたのでしたが、この頃には零落してピザに移住していたのだと云われています。それで生活にも余裕がなかったので、父はその息子のガリレオが育つにつれて、将来は商人にでもして家を興してゆこうと考えたのでしたが、どうも息子が学問を好むので、ピザの大学で医学を学ばせることにしたのでした。ところがガリレオは医者になるのも好まなかったらしく、幼年の頃から好きな数学の講義を廊下で熱心に立ち聞きしているという有様なので、或る公爵家の家庭教師がそれを知って数学と物理学とを学ばせるように父親をも説得したということです。これで見てもガリレオが生来純粋の学問をどれほど望んでいたかがわかるわけです。それでともかくもガリレオは喜んで学業に励みましたが、一五八九年になって、或る侯爵の推薦でこのピザの大学の数学教授に任命されました。それが僅かに二十五歳のことでありますから、彼の学才のいかにすぐれていたかが想察されるのです。\\n さてガリレイはその後一五九一年まで二年間この大学の教職に就いていましたが、その間に既にいろいろの研究にとりかかり、特に有名な自由落下の法則をまず最初に見つけ出しました。之はいろいろの物体が地球の上で自由に落ちる場合に、その速さがどう変ってゆくかを示す法則なのです。この問題について、その頃まではなお一般に昔のギリシャ時代の哲学者であったアリストテレスの説が信ぜられていたので、それによると比重の大きいものほど速く落ちるというので、例えば鉄片と木片とを同時に落すと、鉄片の方が遥かに速く落ちるということになりますが、ガリレイはそれを疑って、ともかく事実をたしかに突きとめなくてはならないと考えて、いろいろ実験を行って見たのでした。この実験をピザの斜塔で行ったということが話には伝わっていますが、それにはどうも確かな証拠はないようです。しかし、何れにしても、そのような実験からガリレイが自由落下の法則を見つけ出したのには違いないのでしょう。つまりガリレイは最初から科学では自然の事実に基づかなくてはいけないという信念を強く持っていたのでした。\\n もう一つ有名な伝説として、ガリレイがピザの大寺院のなかでその天井からつり下げられている吊灯の揺れるのを見て、その往復する時間が揺れ方の大小に係わらないことを見つけ出したということが話されて居り、之は彼の学生時代のことだと云われていますが、之もよほど疑わしいので、現在この寺院にある青銅の吊灯にある銘を見ると、それより数年後の日附がしるされているのです。ですからこの伝説そのままはやはり信ぜられないのですが、同じく実験の上からガリレイが振子の揺れ方に関する法則を見つけ出したということだけは確かだと考えられています。ここでも彼は事実をいろいろ調べてその法則に到達したのに違いないのです。\\n この頃には時計といってもごく粗雑なものしかなかったので、その後は医者が病人の脈搏の速さを測るのに、かような振子をつかった脈搏計というものをつくって、それを使ったそうで、これはなかなかおもしろい事がらだと思われます。\\n\\n壮年時代\\n\\nピザの大学でガリレイは教授ではありましたが、その俸給はごく少くて、ようやく自分一人が生活するにも足りない程度でした。ところが一五九一年に父が歿くなったので、その家族を扶養しなくてはならなくなり、その儘では過ごすことができなくなったので、そこで以前にピザにゆく時に世話になった侯爵がまた彼のために奔走し、そのおかげで翌年バドーヴァの大学に転任することになりました。\\n パドーヴァの大学にはその後十八年間在職しましたが、この時期こそガリレイの生涯において最も幸福な、また最も精根を尽して研究に専心することのできた時代であったのでした。その頃彼の学識の高いことはヨーロッパの諸国に広く伝えられたので、その名声を慕って諸国からたくさんの学徒が集まって来て、その講義は千人を容れるだけの大講堂で行っても、なお狭くて収容しきれない程であったということでした。ところがそうなると、授業に費す時間がどうしても多くなって、それだけ自分の研究が妨げられるので、彼はようやくもっと自由の時間をもつことのできるような地位を望むようになり、一六一〇年になって再びピザに戻り、今度はそこで最も名誉のある「大公国の第一哲学者」として迎えられました。\\n パドーヴァ時代にガリレイは、コペルニクスの書物を読んで、その学説の正しいことを感じ、自分でも之を研究してみたいと望んだのでした。コペルニクスという人はポーランドの国の僧侶であったのですが、イタリヤへ来て学問を修め、その後帰国してから、有名な地動説を称え、その書物は一五四三年に彼の没する直前に出版されて、それから世に広まったのでしたが、その頃の宗教家のはげしい非難に遇って、殆んど禁止の運命に置かれていたのでした。宗教家の反対というのはキリスト教の聖書に、我々人間は神にかたどってつくられたものであり、そしてこの人間の住んでいる地球は宇宙の中心にあって、あらゆる天体はそれをめぐっているということが記されているのに、コペルニクスの地動説では、太陽のまわりを地球が廻っていると説くので、これは神聖な聖書にそむく虚偽異端の説であるというのでした。ガリレイは併し、この宇宙の正しい事実を言いあらわす科学こそ神の栄光と偉大さとをいとも驚くべくもの語るものであって、之を禁圧するのは、それこそかえって神の意志に背くものであるという強固な信条のもとに、寧ろコペルニクスの説を肯定しようとしたのでした。併しその頃の宗教家たちには、そのようなすぐれた思想のわかる筈はありません。かえって自分たちの狭い考えに捉われて、依然として之に反対していました。\\n ところが、その当時ドイツにヨハンネス・ケプラーというすぐれた若い学者があって、オーストリーのグラーツ大学で数学の講師をしていましたが、この人が惑星の軌道について研究した結果をガリレイの許に送って来ました。このケプラーは有名な惑星運動の法則を立てた人ですが、その仕事はずっと後に完成したので、この時の研究というのはそれ以前のものに過ぎなかったのですが、それでもガリレイは之に非常な興味を感じ、彼に親愛に充ちた返書を送りました。そのなかには、「私はコペルニクスの運命を恐れています。彼は少数の人たちからは不朽の栄誉を得たとしても、愚者に充ちた大多数の民衆にとっては軽蔑と汚辱との対象にしか過ぎないでしょう」と云う言葉が記されています。\\n その後ガリレイは天体観測を自分で行おうと考え、オランダで発明された望遠鏡の話を聞いて、それと同様のものを製作し、望遠鏡でいろいろな星を観測しました。之は一六〇九年のことで、その結果として月に高い山のあることや、銀河がたくさんの星の集まりであること、木星には四つの月が附随していること、金星、水星が月と同じように盈ち虧けを示すこと、太陽に黒点のあることなどを見つけ出し、それらの事がらからコペルニクスの説の真であることをますます確信するようになりました。\\n\\n宗教裁判とその晩年\\n\\nところが一六一〇年に、ガリレイがピザに帰ってからは、その地がローマ法王の直接の管下に属するだけに、ますます宗教家たちの反対が強くなり、異端説を主張するのをひどく責めるようになりました。その間にガリレイは、その誤解を説き、また科学と宗教との異なることを示そうとしてあらゆる努力を費しましたが、それは到底当時の人々の耳には入らなかったので、また中にはガリレイの名声の高いのを嫉む人々の策謀などもそれに混って来て、遂には大僧正の命令で地動説を称えてはならないということを警告されました。之は一六一六年のことでしたが、その後も併しガリレイは自分の信念だけは変えませんでした。併しただ当分のうちはできるだけ事を荒立てないように黙って過ごしましたが、数年経てからは事情もいくらか違って来たので、一六二九年になって問答の形式で普通に「天文対話」と呼ばれている書物を著し一六三二年に之を出版しました。\\n ところがこの書物についてある僧侶がローマ法王に讒言したので、法王は宗教裁判所に審査させることになり、その結果この讒言は通らなかったのでしたが、ガリレイは之によって大僧正の以前の警告を無視しているという判決が下されて、ローマに出頭を命ぜられました。ガリレイはこの時既に七十歳に近い老年で、おまけに病身で衰弱していましたが、その冬の寒い季節に止むなく旅に出かけ、翌年の二月にようやくローマに到着しました。併し疲労が甚だしいので暫くの間静養が許され、四月になって裁判所で審問が始まりました。\\n この審判の結果は、ガリレイの書物の領布を禁じ、地動説を放棄することを条件として閑居を命ぜられたので、その宣告の日には自分でその判決文を読んで宣誓のために署名をさせられたのでした。それからガリレイはフィレンツェの自分の家に帰って、そこに閉じこもって晩年を送りましたが、この間の彼の生活は実に寂しい有様ですごされました。その一人娘のバージニアが彼の病苦をやさしく慰めはしたものの、その後まもなく彼に先き立って没くなりました。でも、ガリレイの唯一つの慰めはその科学上の研究にあったので、これ迄に行ったいろいろな研究をまとめて、それを一六三八年に出版しました。之は普通に「力学対話」と呼ばれていますが、以前の「天文対話」と同じように問答の形式に書かれているので、そこに始めて科学研究の正しい道が示されている点で非常に重要な書物なのであります。\\n ところが、ガリレイ自身はそれ以前から眼をわずらっていて、この書物が出版された頃にはもはや両眼とも全く盲目になっていて、せっかくの自分の書物を見ることができなかったと云うのですから、実に惨ましい極みでもありました。それでも彼の精神は最後までしっかりしていたとのことで、以前からガリレイのためになみなみならぬ心尽しをされたトスカナの大公爵はいつも彼の病床を見舞われて慰問をなし、有名な詩人ミルトンなども彼を訪ずれました。そしてその病床には最も忠実な弟子であったヴィヴィアニ及びトリチェリが絶えず傍に侍していたということです。かくてガリレイは一六四二年の一月八日に、七十八歳の高齢でこの世を去りましたが、一生を科学のために尽した満足をもって安らかにその生を終ったのでありましょう。ガリレイの死後にも寺院はなお迫害を加えていたのですが、後の時代になってはかえってそれとは反対に誰しもがガリレイの不朽の功績をたたえるようになったのですから、この事はあらゆる人々にとっての絶大な教訓でなければなりません。つまりそれはガリレイが何等の私心もなく、ひたすらに真理のために尽した偉大な仕事のおかげによるのです。しかも科学の上での真理は永遠に消え失せることもなく、人間の社会が進めば進むほど、ますますそのなかにすばらしい輝きを増してくるようになるのです。今ではフィレンツェの聖十字院のなかにガリレイの立派な墓碑が立てられ、博物館にはその立像が置かれ、彼の製作した望遠鏡やその他の器械が陳列されて、そぞろに彼の面影を偲ばしめています。',
