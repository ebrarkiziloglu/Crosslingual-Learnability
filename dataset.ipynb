opportunity cost?\\nThat's right, yes, that's right, so, in actual fact, this area here, right, is going to be the discounted sum of all future rural incomes.\\nAlright, now if we look at the, the rural instead of the urban wage rate, right, up here alright, now let's just say that it takes that amount of time before this individual gets a job in the urban area, alright, now if we discount alright the erm, the rural, the urban wages right, that's all this\\nWhy have you just discounted it to there?\\nSorry?\\nWhy have you discounted it to W R?\\nWell it's, well, er, there's no need why that should be the case, it could be, you know, it could look something like that.\\nBut, up in the, there the migrant's decision making process will be, is this area here right, is that area there, greater than that area there.\\nAlright, so this is the discounted sum in er, in non-agriculture, in the urban area, and this is the value, the discounted sum in agriculture.\\nNow, clearly on the, on the way I've drawn this diagram it is.\\nRight, but that's going to depend on right, not only the wage differential, now if the wage differential is very large it's likely that this discounted sum is going to, you know, be larger than that.\\nBut it also depends on the time it takes to get the job.\\nI mean if we got a job somewhere out here then it clearly wouldn't be.\\nSo it's this, it's the time taken to get this erm, er, to get the job's going to be important.\\nNow if we think of W U as being er, the expected value of the urban wage, and that equals the probability of getting a job, multiplied by the actual urban wages, alright then this probability of getting a job is going to be important as well.\\nAnd that's it then, scruffy diagram, but what more have we got?\\nAn urban wage, a rural wage, right, we discount those wages over time, right and that area there, shading the area in the blue sort of box, then this it's erm, it's going to be rational for this er, migrant, this person to become a migrant.\\nEven though, I mean this doesn't say anything about unemployment levels, levels of unemployment.\\nUnem the level of unemployment is subsumed between, well, within the time it takes to get a job, and also the probability of, of getting a job.\\nAlright.\\nSo this sort of, even that's just what the Harrison model erm, tells us, right, so that's, unemployment rates are, are virtually erm, unimportant in the migrant's decision.\\nUnemployment rates now, it's because they may well be, if they're acting rationally, discount over a very large, long period of time.\\nOkay just er, just to ask, is this erm, migration, it, does it cause a problem?\\nI mean I thought that migration was the er, would be the cure of all ills, in that, you know, we've got wage differentials here in this, in this hypothetical economy.\\nSurely if you migrate that increases the supply of labour, it reduces the supply of labour in the rural sector, it increases the supply of labour in er, the urban sector, unless wage, wage rates should equalize?\\nNo.\\nWhat, what, why don't, why doesn't, why don't wage rates equalize?\\nBecause erm, the urban sector is normally considered to be capital intensive a sector, and the rural area in L D Cs are considered more labour intensive, and so erm, obviously when you get an influx of labour, and changes to the capital to labour ratio\\nMhm\\nerm, and you would see er, a shift in capital to, to agriculture as the return on capital in urban falls,\\nmhm\\nand this would, you would think, because there's a shift back of capital to agriculture you'd get a rise in agricultural wage rates because that changes the capital to labour ratio again and so this would counteract the movement.\\nHowever, there is a problem, capital is not perfectly mobile, like you can apply a new machine into, well maybe you could cos that's .\\nWhatever, you can't apply the urban type of capital back onto the land, so it's okay to say this would work if capital was completely and perfectly mobile, but it isn't so, you don't get that and you don't get balanced growth of that.\\nBecause er, everything shifts in the wrong direction.\\nThat's right, I mean, in order to eq equalize wages between sector, labour and also capital has to be perfectly mobile.\\nNow, if it's not, we know that labour isn't, isn't perfectly mobile, it appeared, migration would seem to suggest it's, it's pretty mobile geographically, but it may not be particularly mobile occupationally.\\nSo that these people go to the urban areas to get the jobs, they're not trained erm, for these jobs right and as a result, these wages rates still, may still be maintained despite the fact there are lots of people who are quite happy to take wages erm, in, take up jobs in the urban sectors, it's the fact that sort of, employers don't want them, because they don't have the requisite skills.\\nAlso, where, what are the erm, what're the highest paid jobs in the urban sector?\\nThey are essentially in developing countries.\\nThey are essentially government jobs.\\nRight.\\nNow, er, without wishing to generalize too much, bribery, corruption, you know, it's not what you know, it's who you know, are very important factors in er, in employment in developing countries.\\nAnd as a result they are\\nIt's much nicer to say patronage, you promise to say patronage.\\nAh, patronage, okay, that's er, a nice euphemism to see the\\nThen you don't like slander people.\\nThat's right, in that erm, you're, the probability of you getting a well paid job is greatly enhanced, if not guaranteed if you know er, the people who are employing you.\\nAnd this sort of thing goes, is, is rife in developing countries.\\nI mean the old boy network is pretty bad in this country, but er, it's similar sorts of things go on in developing countries, and because there's much less of an industrial sector there, the government sector itself, erm, plays a very important role in, in employment.\\nNow, was it you Lyn who had some statistics some saying er, what proportion\\nFine I've got,I've got to use stat statistics to\\nWell it works, erm, there were some\\nYes.\\nI can't remember if it was you or somebody else, had er, some data as to how many of the er, jobs in urban areas where the government\\nI put erm, studies by Helen and Tate, nineteen eighty three, found public sector employment averaged forty four percent of non-agricultural employment in twenty L D Cs and in extreme cases were Tanzania and Zambia, were as high as seventy eight and eighty one percent respectively.\\nAnd I think he quote those, or they didn't quote them in much, as much detail as I did in the lectures.\\nI'd got these figures down, but I hadn't really got anything against them, he just quickly went through the percentages so yes.\\nOkay, so\\nAnd developed countries averaged twenty four percent, so it's twice as much as developed countries.\\nRight, so given sort of erm, public and semi-public institutions, right, represent a large proportion of the non- agricultural erm, employment opportunities, and as a result, alright, the rates of pay in the, in the civil service, essentially, are going to, going to determine erm, the urban, the urban wage rate.\\nNow if those, erm, wages in the civil service are set, not through sort of market process, but sort of through institutional er, constraints, you know, it's unlikely there's going to be sort of er, union power erm, in these sorts of jobs, but nevertheless, civil servants tend to do quite well at giving themselves pay increases\\nConservative government.\\nand er, and as a result, you know, institutes, the wages in government bodies tend to be quite high, and because gov government bodies represent such a large proportion of er, non- agricultural employment they, they represent a much more sort of, a much more potent influence than they would do in a, in a developed country where the government sector is much, much smaller.\\nErm okay what was the importance of implication of er, Harrison model?\\nThere was one policy implication.\\nThat, what was it, that erm people still move.\\nObviously, we that right, people will still move if unemployment's high, but if you try, if the government tries and gets rid of unem urban unemployment, say people have moved because of it, so there's unemployment there to start with because of the reasons we've discussed earlier, so then the government said okay, well let's get rid of the unemployment that has occurred already, by erm, either, at the same wage rate trying to well yes, the same, they'll keep wage rates the same, but erm, increase, you know, make the public sector bigger or, or do something to create urban jobs, and basically all it will do is, encourage more migrants because they'll see the probability of getting a job will increase so the expected wage will increase so you'll get migration on top of what's already occurring.\\nAnd, erm, you won't solve anything.\\nThat's right, so, if you want to try and erm, minimize urban unemployment, right, or it's futile to try and minimize urban unemployment by erm, er, establishing employment er, job creation schemes in urban areas, because that will increase the probability of getting a job if you're a migrant.\\nRight, so there are these government job creation schemes, alright.\\nNow, because it's typically observed in the Harrison model shows this under certain circumstances to be the case, that, erm, a sort of erm, migration elasticity with respect to income differentials, right, is much greater than the erm,\\nThe rate of unemployment, the level of unemployment\\nThat's right, yes, yes, that's right, because erm, there's a gre there's a higher elasticity of migration inelasticity in respect to income differentials than there is to unemployment, any job creation schemes will lead to more migration, rather than, rather than less, so how, how best to get round the problem?\\nIf job creation schemes aren't in urban areas, are the best way to get round them, isn't it, if we can show, quite simply, that job creation schemes lead to more migration, which lead to more unemployment.\\nThe policy's self repeating, what policies might ?\\nA policy of cross-training,for all areas.\\nOkay, yeah, so, what might those, what form might those policies take, what might they be?\\non it .\\nYes, population controls, that's right, that's one, I mean, one reason, one way of getting rid of the migration is to, is to, is to limit population growth.\\nWhere's the population growth highest?\\nIt's at its highest in rural areas, this is what's being done.\\nErm, population control is always focused out in the rural areas,the most difficult place to do it, because populations are dispersed, er, that's where population growth, right, is the highest.\\nAny other?\\nMaking incentives to actually raise the wage rates in the, in the rural areas so, sort of to, to increase production or, and through, through farming.\\nTo improve their situation,\\nRight, yeah\\nimprove their wages through farming and perhaps\\nThat's right,\\nput more infrastructure in so that then the farmers can send their children to school rather than work on the land.\\nyeah, that's right, what we want to try and do is to improve the erm, the returns to, to agriculture which is the main form of er, sort of income in rural areas.\\nI mean if you do things like that while improving infrastructure, erm, setting up credit, government credit facilities, er, so, so, so we can lend, we could lend money to small farms.\\nIncrease in information about unem unemployment itself, that is a, that is a problem, people have this misapprehensions about the probability of getting a job\\nYou could also erm, start to recognize the benefit of the rural sector, and one reason why they were discriminating, L D Cs tended to want to ignore that and sort of shun it, because it's not sort of a glamorous image they were trying to hope for in the urban sector, and, so, if they did help them, say give them units, like the repair men, units to work in, and they put them in really totally crappy accommodation, and up not where you need it, and not where people pass by with their motors and things, they, they'd put them somewhere up on a hill, overlooking a city, so erm, to encourage the informal sector by erm, sort of on a par with the formal sector because erm, their inter- reacting, inter-relating now, like they're providing cheap inputs for the formal industries and, and the formal industries are pro providing clientele all for the informal sector, and so it's all inter-linked and, and it's there now.\\nIt's not going to disappear, cos it's quite a large part of urban areas.\\nThey could do that.\\nYes, we want to try and improve resource allocation in the economy and one way of doing that is not necessarily subsidizing agricultural production, but remove the taxes on agricultural growth.\\nAlright, and effectively what's, what's happening is that the government sectors in erm, in developing countries are very highly subsidized.\\nRight, they're overmanned, alright, they have very high wages, alright, er, that is one of the major courses of er, causes of resource mis-allocation, it's this very large, very inefficient government sector.\\nAnd er, one way to, to get people to stay on the land is to introduce some sort of, what we might call market disciplines, if that wasn't such a dirty word, er, into the government, the government sector where there are clear inefficiencies.\\nOkay, right, erm it's nearly time to go, but before we do, can I just give you some bits and pieces, you, you may well have copies of last year's exam paper, but if you haven't, this is for development and integration of trade er, have a look at those sorts of essays you're being asked to do.\\nBut also, look as those er, those short answers, now it's important that you answer the short answer questions well alright, because it's, it's a lot easier to get good marks on a short answer question, providing you do it well, than it is on a long answer question.\\nAlright, erm, but most people don't, don't ans don't answer short answer questions very well at all, and that's why they get low, low marks for them.\\nAlways re bear in mind, that whenever you do a short answer question, right, you've only got fifteen minutes to do it in.\\nRight, there, there isn't a great deal that you can get in, in fifteen minutes.\\nBut what, what you must have, right, is a definition of erm, the er, sort of thing that you're asked to write about.\\nI mean, factor price equalization, intra-industry measuring intra-industry trade, optimal intervention, reciprocal dumping, they're all jargon, bits of jargon effect effectively, so you must, you must have a definition.\\nRight now, although the determinals in industrial specialization within countries, alright, now although you can't really define that, you might be able to say something about industrial specialization.\\nYou know it's fairly obvious what it is, but with most of these will, will require, require a definition.\\nRight, so you must put a definition, a definition in there.\\nAn example of it in use, and you must have ex what I'm saying, it's very important to have empirical erm, examples in your essays, right, because they will also be required in the short answer questions as well.\\nRight, you know, what is an example of erm, reciprocal dumping?\\nRight now you may, erm,don't know anything in particular, but I know that the European Community and the United, United States are always trying to out, erm, beat each other in terms of subsidies on food products, so put, put that in.\\nReciprocal dumping, erm, you know, one very good example would be agricultural trade between European Community and erm, and America.\\nAlright, if it's a, so you, you've got to have a definition, alright, you must have a, an example of it in, in action.\\nAny form of empirical evidence is useful, alright, erm sometimes you know, you're asked, you know, what is the effective protection, or define, or write brief a brief essay on effective protection, right you'll, you'll want to say something there about how it's measured.\\nNow what essentially, what you're doing, is that you're writing an essay in very, very condensed form, so it's just, I mean you still, still must have the same recipe in there when you write a short answer, right, but you just have to be very, very brief, so you know,para paragraph on definition, you know, paragraph of examples, right, erm, paragraph on some sort of explanation or erm, how it's, how it's measured erm, has it been a contentious issue erm, what are the problems with this er, with this concept erm, right, you've got to get those sort of things in there, like you would in an essay, if you were asked to write an essay on reciprocal dumping you'd, you'd have all those things in there, right, but you only need to write a sentence, a sentence about them.\\nYou know, nobody's expecting three or four sides, right, you've got quarter of an hour, not erm, you know, if, if you can write a side a half you, you'll be doing much better than most people, alright, so you're just thinking about a side really, depending on how big your handwriting is.\\nBut you must have, you know, don't ramble on about the same thing, right, cos, for, for, for any more than a couple of sentences, cos then, you know, you c start entering into sort of diminishing marginal returns very, very quickly on these short answer questions, what you want to, do is sort of say a sentence about as much as you can rather than go into in depth discussion about erm, any particular aspect.\\nAlright, so it's a bit of er, a sort of blunderbuss type of approach that you've got, that you've got to use.\\nGet a definition in, get an application in, get empirical evidence in, get measurement problems in erm, get sort of contentious issues type of, or criticisms in erm, don't draw, don't do diagrams as they're probably, the only, the only principal difference between this and an essay, you just haven't got the time, right, so don't be tempted, unless you can do a very quick diagram that sum, sums it up.\\nAlright, I don't recommend doing diagrams cos you spend five, five ten minutes drawing the diagram and explaining you know, what the curves are on it, erm, so you don't really need to draw, draw diagrams in these short answer questions.\\nAgain that's only a general principle.\\nOccasionally you might be, but erm, if I can, if you look at er, the erm, the European Community's erm, short answers, right, they've actually given you an except there, a dia diagram, right.\\nQuestion, question one,question two, alright.\\nIt's a pretty complicated diagram, I wouldn't expect you to draw that in fifteen minutes, and explain the, the\\nIf they give you a diagram like that, can you just talk about the lines, you don't have to say what they are?\\nNo, that's right, yes.\\nBasically, you could say like with gains or something, gains are A, B, C.\\nYes\\nThat's right,\\nI reckon that's, that's the way that\\nit will be assu it will be assumed that, yes\\neverything on there is known about that, just specific areas.\\nAlright, but you know, you've got so little time, you know, fifteen minutes is very, very short period of time, so whatever you say\\nNot wanting to induce panicking .\\nWhat I do recommend you do is er, you know, use these short answers in your, in your revision, and sort of, you know, revise on say interim district trade, and then just write a question in fifteen minutes, and you realize that you can't really write very much, and it's good discipline, because once you've made the mistake, you know, of writing, you know, two paragraphs on some aspect of it, you realize you haven't got any time to, to do anything else.\\nYou won't, hopefully you won't make that mistake again, so, short, sweet, crisp answers to these erm, these short answer questions.\\nDon't bother doing diagrams, get a sentence in on everything you know, right although it's not\\nWell, that doesn't sound very sophisticated to say, these are the questions when you just write everything you know about a particular issue.\\nBut they are, you do straight out what you can think up about it.\\nYes, that's essentially, essentially it.\\nApart from the essays\\nwrite anyway for thirty minutes\\nNot quite the same approach there, but I mean, it's not, not everything you know, but write something about everything you know about\\nAlright\\nthe short answers.\\nA, a sentence on everything you can, think of that, that relates to it, but if you do,do practise them, it's only just to, to talk about it, it's difficult to

Babasıyla birlikte tüm salonu ve mutfağı balonlarla süslemişti. Harika görünüyordu!\\n\\n\"Günaydın, doğum günü çocuğu!\" dedi gülümseyerek.\\n\\n\"Günaydın anne!\" diye haykırdı Milo, gözleri heyecanla parlıyordu. \"Doğum günü kurabiyeleri mi yapıyoruz?\"\\n\\n\"Tabii ki evet,\" diye yanıtladı, saçlarını okşarken. \"Onlarsız bir doğum günü olamaz.
